	 	1)"Encapsulation" means "data-hiding"
	 	2)To encapsulate, we use "private" keyword
	 	3)By the help of "encapsulation" you will be able to do many tasks by using only a single object
	 	  i)Create an object	ii)By using setters update the values which you need then work with newly updated object
