	/*
	 	1) throws, throw, try, catch, finally, compile time exception(checked), runtime exception(unchecked),

		2) Differences between "throw" and "throws"
		    i)"throw" is used in "method body"
		    ii)After "throw" keyword we create an object by using Exception classes but after "throws" keyword
		       we type just the name of Exception Class
            iii)After "throws" keyword you can use multiple Exception class names by separating them by comma
                but after "throw" keyword you can create just a single object
                Note: After "throws" keyword parent and child Exception classes cannot be used together, Java removes child and replace parent automatically
            iv) "throws" can be used once at most in a method but "throw" can be used many times in a method body
