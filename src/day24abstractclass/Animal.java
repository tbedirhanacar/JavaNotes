	/*
	 	1) Sometimes we need methods without body(Abstrack Methods) because sometimes
	 	   we do not use the body of some methods anytime;
	 	2) To create an "abstract method" i) Do not put method body
	 								     ii) Use "abstract" keywod between access modifier and return type
	 									iii) "absract methods" can be created just in abstract classes
	 								   Note: To make a class abstract use "abstract" keyword before "class"
	 								   	  	 keyword
	 	3) Abstract classes can have both "abstract methods" and "concrete methods" 
	 	4) Abstract methods must be overridden by all CONCRETE chils classes but it is optional for
	 	   concrete methods. 
	 	   If you want to make a functionality must for child classes use
	 	   abstract method for the functionality.
	 	5) "abstract" keyword and "method body" cannot be used at the same time in a method.
	 	6) An abstract class can have "abstract child class"
	 	7) It is not mandatory for "abstract child class" to override "abstract methods" from parent class.
	 	8) If any "abstract method" is overriden by any parent class, it will not be mandatory for child classes.
	 	9) Abstract methods cannot be "final" because "abstract methods" will have newly updated body in every child class
	 	   but "final method" means no update in body	
	   10) Abstract methods cannot be "private" because we create "abstract methods" just for child classes usage
	       but if you make "abstract methods" private child classes cannot access to it.
