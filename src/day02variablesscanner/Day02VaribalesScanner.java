		Data types in Java
		Note: In Java there are 2 main data types
		
			1)Primitive Data Types
				
				a)boolean: It has 2 different values which are "true" and "false"
					Every boolean variable uses a single "bit" in memory
					booleans have "false" as default value
				b)char: It is used for single characters
						Value must be put between single quotes like 'S'
						Every char uses 16 bits in the memory
				c)byte: It is used for "whole numbers" between -128 and 127
						It uses 8 bits from memory
				d)short: It is used for "whole numbers" between -32768 and 32767
						 It uses 16 bits from the memory
				e)int: It is used for "whole numbers" between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,648
					   It uses 32 bits from the memory
				f)long: It is used for "whole numbers" between (so long) and (so long)
						It uses 64 bits from the memory
						Note: Every whole number is int for Java as default. When you create a "long" variable, you have to put
						"L" to the end to inform Java, the number is not int it is long. Otherwise you'll get error
				g)float: It is used "Decimal Numbers"
						 It uses 32 bits from the memory.
						 Note: Every decimal number is double for Java as default. When you create a "float" variable, you have to put
						"F" to the end to inform Java, the number is not double it is float. Otherwise you'll get error
						 You can have 7 digits in decimal part at most
				h)double It is used for "Decimal Numbers"
						 It uses 64 bits from the memory.
						 You can have 16 digits in decimal part at most
				
			Note: "=" is used to assign value to a variable
				  "==" is used to compare 2 values if they are equal to each other
				  "!=" means "not equal to"
				  
			Note: If all values in operation is integer the result will be integer in Java
				  If the result is decimal in Math, Java converts the decimal to integer just by removing decimal part
				  Java doesn't do "rounding" operation
				  
			2)Non-Primitive Data Type:	
			 	
			 	String: It is used for "Multiple Characters" 
			 	
			Note: "Stack Memory" is small and contains i)primitive data
													   ii)Addresses(references) of the non-primitive data
				  "Heap Memory" is large memory and contains non-primitive data									   	
						
			Note: What is the difference between "primitive" and "non-primitive" data types?
				  a)Primitive data type names are typed just by using lower cases, but non-primitive data types use
				    upper case at the beginning
				  b)Primitive data types are just 8, but non-primitive data types are unlimited.
				  c)Primitive data types were created by Java, we cannot create primitive data types.
				    But non
				  d)Primitive data types are stored in "Stack Memory" and non-primitive data types are stored in "Heap Memory"	
				  e)Primitive data types have just "values" in them.
